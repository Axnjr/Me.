                    <p id='des'>Ok, First things first my actual name is Yakshit It's weird so I call myself Axn.
                    I am an Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning student at Mumbai University although I
                    am more intrigued by the web world currently. I don't consider what I do as work, 
                    I cherish spending time-solving problems and creating UI and the best user experience.  The web is not my only skill
                    but the most interesting one. I am currently preparing for coding interviews and looking for a few internships
                    and even full-time opportunities as I can proudly say that until now whatever I have learned is all by myself
                    I think Universities are not important for learning new Skills it just depends on us ourself's. 
                    I love connecting with great people, hearing new perspectives, exploring creative ideas, and understanding concepts 
                    so please reach out to me at (yakshitchhipa@gmail.com).
